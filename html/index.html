        <p>Southampton Cenotaph</p>
        <p><b>Southampton Cenotaph</b> is a <b><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">First World War</a></i></b> memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and
             located in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">Watts Park </a>in the southern English city of Southampton.
             <b><i>The memorial</i></b>  was 
             the first of dozens by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">Lutyens</a>
              to be built in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials"> permanent</a> 
              form and it<a>influenced</a>   his later designs, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">Cenotaph </a>in London. It is a 
              tapering, multi-tiered 
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">pylon</a> which culminates in a series of 
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials"> diminishing </a> layers
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials"> before</a> 
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">terminating </a>
              in a 
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">sarcophagus (or cenotaph, 'empty tomb')</a>
               which 
            </a>features a recumbent figure of a soldier. In front is an altar-like Stone of Remembrance. 
             The  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">cenotaph </a> contains multiple
              <a href="">sculptural</a> details including a prominent cross, the town's
              coat of arms, and two lions. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">names </a> of the dead are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">inscribed </a> 
              on three sides. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">Although </a> similar in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">outline</a>,
               later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">cenotaphs  </a> by Lutyens were much more austere and featured almost no sculpture. The design uses abstract, ecumenical features and lifts the recumbent soldier high above eye level, anonymising him
            <p>The memorial was unveiled at a public <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">ceremony </a>on 6 November 1920. 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">Shortly afterwards</a>,
                 concerns <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">emerged</a> that the list of names on the cenotaph was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">incomplete</a>. 
                 After a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_memorials">></a>newspaper campaign, more than 200 further names were identified and these were eventually added to the cenotaph. The names of most Jewish casualties were omitted, the Jewish community being unhappy that the memorial featured a Christian cross. By the beginning of the 21st century, the engravings on the memorial had deteriorated noticeably. Rather than re-cut them and damage the stonework, they were supplemented by a series of glass panels which bear all the names from the cenotaph, as well as names from the Second World War and later conflicts. The panels were unveiled in 2011.</p> 

            <p> <b><i>The memorial</i></b> is a <em> Grade I </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building" title="Listed building">listed building</a>, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens's war memorials were declared a national collection </p>
